![David Mart√≠n-Corral](/assets/img/David.jpg)  
<br>  
Hello, I am a **restless soul** passionate about exploring the connections between science, technology, and consciousness.  

As an **artist, engineer, and entrepreneur**, I have extensive experience in the creative and building process, as well as in the tech and academic sectors. I combine technical knowledge with a deep curiosity about the human soul.  

My interests focus on **improving health and well-being** as well as **exploring the limits of consciousness** through psychonautics. Through my art, projects, and publications, **I seek to inspire other souls to be more authentic and to create a more conscious future.**  

As an artist, I engage in subversive action to help open hearts and awaken consciousness.  

<br>  
### **üíª Professional Experience**  

_I try to help with my skills._  

Currently, I am **co-founder of [Heratropic](https://heratropic.com)**, a company where we design technologies to enhance people's self-awareness and help them navigate the ontological shift we are experiencing. Previously, I was **co-founder and CEO of Zensei**, a digital health startup for respiratory patients. I was also **co-founder of Politibot**, a startup focused on political news that won Google's DNI award two years in a row. And I have worked on other failed projects to get where I am today.  

I led data science practices at **Smartvel** and the data-driven health product team at **Sanitas (Bupa)** as a **Senior Data Scientist**. Before that, I worked at **IBM** as an **Advanced Analytics Consultant**, designing and building the first Big Data platforms and data science initiatives in Spain. As a **data scientist with over 15 years of experience, I have deployed more than 500 statistical learning (AI) models** and helped launch data and artificial intelligence initiatives for companies such as **BBVA, CaixaBank, Bankinter, 24symbols, SafeTrack, Quantyca, Getro, and Fandit**.  

For over 10 years, I have been teaching at multiple academic institutions, including **Universidad Pontificia de Comillas, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Universidad de Alcal√°, Instituto de Empresa, The Power Business School, and The Valley Business School**. I also give talks and courses to various audiences and organizations on data science, artificial intelligence, complex social systems, and digital health.  

As a researcher, I have published in high-impact journals such as *Nature* and *PNAS* and was a **visiting researcher at the Human Dynamics Lab at MIT Media Lab** (USA).  

I have solid experience leading and working with multicultural teams internationally in both industrial and academic environments. My approach is centered on empathetic leadership, continuous adaptation to change, and achieving goals.
